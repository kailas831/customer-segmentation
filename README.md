# Customer Segmentation Using RFM and K-Means Clustering

## Overview
This project segments customers based on purchasing behavior using RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis and K-Means clustering. It helps identify high-value customers and improve marketing strategies.

## Tech Stack
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn)
- MySQL (Data storage)
- Power BI (Dashboard and Reporting)

## Project Workflow
1. Data Extraction from MySQL
2. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
3. RFM Analysis
4. K-Means Clustering for Segmentation
5. Visualization with Python and Power BI

## Results
- Customers grouped into meaningful segments (e.g., VIPs, one-time buyers)
- Visualized purchasing patterns
- Business insights ready for strategic decision-making
